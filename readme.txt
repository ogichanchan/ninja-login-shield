== Description ==
Ninja Login Shield is a straightforward, PHP-only WordPress utility designed to enhance your login security and user experience. It acts as a shield by implementing a dynamic honeypot protection system to detect and block automated bot login attempts. Additionally, it offers customizable login messages, allowing you to set a welcoming message and replace standard login failure errors with a more generic, custom notification, which helps prevent information disclosure to potential attackers. Focused on simplicity and efficiency, this plugin integrates seamlessly into your WordPress login process with minimal overhead.
