1.  **Plugin Name:** Ninja Login Shield
2.  **Short Description:** A unique PHP-only WordPress utility. A ninja style login plugin acting as a shield. Focused on simplicity and efficiency.
3.  **Detailed Description:** Ninja Login Shield is a lightweight, PHP-only WordPress plugin designed to enhance login security and user experience through intelligent bot detection and customizable messages. It acts as a "shield" for your login page without relying on complex scripts or external dependencies.

    **Key Features:**

    *   **Honeypot Bot Protection:** Implements a hidden honeypot field on the login form. This field is invisible to legitimate users but often filled by automated bots. If the honeypot is triggered, the login attempt is blocked, protecting your site from brute-force attacks and spam.
        *   **Customizable Honeypot:** Easily enable/disable the honeypot, and set a custom field name (dynamically generated by default for enhanced security), label, and error message directly from the plugin settings.
    *   **Custom Login Messages:** Take control of the messages displayed on your WordPress login screen.
        *   **General Login Message:** Add a welcoming or instructional message that appears above the login form.
        *   **Custom Failed Login Message:** Replace generic WordPress login errors (e.g., "incorrect password" or "invalid username") with a custom, more user-friendly, or less revealing message, improving security by not giving away too much information to potential attackers.
    *   **PHP-Only & Efficient:** Built purely with PHP and inline CSS for minimal overhead and maximum compatibility. This ensures a fast and efficient solution without adding extra JavaScript files.
    *   **User-Friendly Settings:** All features are configurable via an intuitive settings page within the WordPress admin area under "Settings > Login Shield."

    Ninja Login Shield offers a simple yet effective way to fortify your login page against bots and customize the user experience, all while maintaining a focus on performance and ease of use.
